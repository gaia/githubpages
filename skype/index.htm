<div align="center"><br><br><h3>Clicking the link below will open up skype and an invite to chat with me.</h3><br>
This is a more direct method than searching for my username on the Skype Directory, since the directory does not allow you to search for username only.<br>
A search for my username "outernational" will bring up a lot of results and you might end up requesting to chat with the wrong "outernational".<br>
